TinyMUX 2.7:  CHANGES
Last Update:  January 2007

Major changes that may affect performance and require softcode tweaks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added mux_string and fixed many functions including EDIT(),
    REVERSE(), and DELETE() (Issues 14, 52, 100, and 232).


Feature Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Support optional action list with @break.  Add corresponding
    @assert command. (Issue 36).
 -- Help files support PennMUSH-style multiple topics for each help
    entry; consecutive &FOO lines refer to the same content
    (Issue 238).  Thanks Alierak.
 -- Added LPAD(), CPAD(), and RPAD() functions to duplicate previous
    non-truncating LJUST(), CENTER(), and RJUST() functionality
    (Issue 13).  Thanks Jake.
 -- Added /delete switch to @function and allow removal of user-defined
    functions (Issue 250).  Thanks Jake.
 -- Added fifth, sort-type argument to SETINTER(), SETUNION(), and
    SETDIFF() (Issue 3).
 -- Added @comjoin, @comleave, @comon, and @comoff for use with channel
    objects.  Each evaluates to a message shown to the channel member
    at the corresponding event (Issue 9).


Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~
 -- INFO should show 'Patches' or 'INFO 1', but not both (Issue 236).
 -- @dolist and @trig were not passing TRACE bit through (Issue 237).
 -- Using \ as a shortcut to @emit no longer causes the beginning of
    the message to be escaped (Issue 219).  Thanks Alierak.
 -- @verb/no_name used unterminated verb_sw table (Issued 243).  Thanks
    Jake.
 -- Guest objects left DARK through announcement code (Issue 244).
 -- @wall evaluated a speechmod before processing the message
    (Issue 16).  Thanks Jake.
 -- @wall's switches did not interact properly (Issue 30).  Thanks
    Jake.
 -- Corrected error messages for failed guest logins (Issue 246).
 -- @function did not strip ansi from or properly truncate user-defined
    function names. (Issue 249).  Thanks Jake.
 -- Fix typo in do_say() which left a bit-wise instead of a logical
    AND operation (Issue 245).
 -- Fix SORT(2 100) --> '100 2' bug introduced in 2.7.0.1 (Issue 251).
 -- Fix trailing padding in CENTER() (Issue 253).
 -- Added mux_string and added ANSI-awareness to many functions
    including EDIT(), REVERSE(), and DELETE() (14, 52, 100, and 232).
    Thanks Jake and Alierak.
 -- mid(abc,-1,2) now returns a, not ab. mid(abc,1,-2) now returns
    ab, not a.  This is the documented behavior.


Performance Enhancements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Help entries use less memory (specific improvements described in
    Issue 238 comments).  Thanks Alierak.
 -- MUNGE() translates results through a hash table instead of
    repeated linear searching (Issue 247).  Thanks Alierak and Ian.
 -- VMAG(), VUNIT, and SHUFFLE() only need LBUF_SIZE/2 elements instead
    of LBUF_SIZE elements.


Cosmetic Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Added Doxygen file headers (Issue 102).


Miscellaneous:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Documented Lbufref and Regref pools in 'wizhelp @list alloc'.
    Thanks Alierak.
 -- Documented use of a single backslash as a proper shortcut to
    @emit (Issue 219).  Thanks Alierak.
 -- Removed unnecessary global pos variable from help.cpp (Issue 265).
