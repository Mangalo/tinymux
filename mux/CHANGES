TinyMUX 2.6:  CHANGES
Last Update:  September 2006

Major changes that may affect performance and require softcode tweaks:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Deprecated LSTACK(), POP(), PUSH(), PEEK(), EMPTY(), and ITEMS().
    These functions are still available via the --enabled-deprecated
    configuration switch.  Requested by Ian.
 -- Port code to the 64-bit edition of Windows XP.  Jake and Brazil.


Feature Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- FCOUNT(<expression>) to tally function invocations in <expression>.
    Requested by Ian.
 -- Add SITEINFO() to return the site flags for a player or port.  Added
    by Jake.
 -- Use Moniker instead of name in enter/leave emits, rob, kill, @toad,
    boot, and in other similar situations.
 -- Add support for %=<attr> substitution. From TinyMUSH 3.
 -- Use localtime_r() if available. By Brazil.
 -- Added command line switch (-n) to control choice of networking
    method on Win32.
 -- Added support for 2-argument mix().
 -- Added optional third 'step' parameter to lnum().
 -- Added optional second argument for lcon() for subseting the returned
    list by type.
 -- The 'You own a floating room' message is only given for rooms which
    are not connected to either the player_startint_room or to a room
    marked FLOATING. Previously, every room not connected to the
    player_starting_room had to be marked FLOATING.
 -- Added QUELL flag from Firan to temporarily suppressWizard powers.
 -- Added @switch/notify.
 -- Merge Firan MUX source modification and collected them under the
    --enable-firanmux ./configuration switch. This also typically
    requires the --enable-memorybased switch. Some of the following
    may eventually be enabled in the default build:

    Attributes:  @alead, @lead, @olead, and @color
    Commands:    @email
    Permissions: no_immobile, no_restricted
    Options:     immobile_message, sql_server, sql_user, sql_password,
                 sql_database, mail_server, mail_ehlo, mail_sendaddr,
                 mail_sendname, and mail_subject.
    Flags:       LINEWRAP, IMMOBILE, RESTRICTED, and PARENT.
    Functions:   sql(), setparent(), setname(), trigger(), mailsize(),
                 mailsubj(), mailj(), text(), successes(), and
                 distribute().

 -- Added --enable-firanmuxconvert which turns on code to remap three
    conflicting attribute numbers. The first database load requires
    this switch, and then it should be turned off.
 -- Included distribute() in the default build.
 -- Added float_precision configuration parameter.
 -- Added TRACE attribute flag which provide a finer-grain debugging
    tool than @set'ing TRACE on the object. Requested by Nixer.
    Implemented by Brazil.
 -- Added escapes for CR, LF, TAB, and ESC to the flatfile format. This
    flatfile no longer contains a mix of CRLF and LF to confuse flatfile
    portability.
 -- Add lflags(<obj>/<attr>) form similar to flags(<obj>/<attr>).
 -- @power will accept multiple power changes in one command.
 -- Add @trigger/notify.
 -- Added etimefmt().
 -- Added nine additional parameters to map() which (if present) are
    passed in as arguments %1-%9.  Suggested by Ian.
 -- Added nine additional parameters to filter() and filterbool() which
    (if present) are passed in as arguments %1-%9.  Suggested by Ronan.
 -- Added lbuf_size as a read-only configuration option so that
    config(lbuf_size) can report it to softcode.
 -- Added STEP() following TinyMUSH and RhostMUSH (Issue 1).


Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~
 -- Fix over one thousand level 4 warnings.  Jake and Brazil.
 -- Deprecate use of strcpy() and strncpy().  Jake and Brazil.
 -- Use size_t where appropriate.  Jake and Brazil.
 -- Deprecate use of sprintf().  By Brazil.
 -- Deprecate use of localtime().  By Brazil.
 -- Fix 'round(-0.5,0)' --> '-0' to be '0' instead.
 -- Disallow the train command from being used on itself.
 -- Add protection to @chownall that victim be a player object.
 -- Fix uninitialized variable in HASRXLEVEL(). It should have used
    'executor' instead of 'player'.
 -- Fix time_t handling for 64-bit machines. Timezones could be wrong
    for dates earlier than Jan 1 1970 on 64-bit Unix.
 -- Fix @hook for goto command. Being unable to move also affected the
    ability to use other commands. Reported by K hall.
 -- Added checking to convsecs() to return '#-1 INVALID DATE" if first
    argument is outside the supported range.
 -- All but the last part of very Long lines from the network were
    discarded when for very long lines, only the first part should be
    saved.  Not a crashing bug.
 -- Server should not attempt to @clone Created and Modified attributes.
 -- Fix single-character case in pos(). It would never return success.
    Bug introduced in 2.6. It does not appear in 2.4.
 -- Change isdbref() to return '0' instead of '#-1 ISDBEF EXPECTS...'
 -- Fix ANSI overflow bug in ANSI_String_Copy() introduced by using an
    unsigned size_t in place of a signed 'int'. Bug introduced in 2.6.
 -- Add 'other half' of buffer overflow protection to a case in
    process_cmdent().  Without the other half, the first half causes a
    crash instead of prventing it.  Found and fixed by Sparks.
 -- Remove double evaluation from distribute() and sql().
 -- Save/Restore global registers while executing @descformat.
 -- Fix map(), filter(), and filterbool() to avoid evaluating the given
    attribute for an empty list.
 -- Strip ANSI from messages before matching messages against @filter
    and @infilter patterns.
 -- Zap trailing NL in help topics.
 -- Added help topic for HTML flag.
 -- When listening on multiple ports, continue to run the server as long
    as one of the requested ports is available.
 -- mix() doesn't include a function-invocation test (Issue 71).
 -- Examples in help topics show old-style 'say' (Issue 72).
 -- Attribute-level tracing does not report sortby() comparisons
    (Issue 73).
 -- @email help doesn't mention @mail addy/subject=body form (Issue 86).
 -- @email - do {} while () to simplify the sources and reduce the
    sizeof the program (Issue 79).
 -- @email - MUX_VERSION replaced with mudstate.short_ver (Issue 78).
 -- @email - mod_email_sock_readline() adds a '\0' one position too far
    (Issue 87).
 -- @email - Remove unnecessary zeroing of buffers (Issue 80).
 -- @email - Typo in do_plusmail of '0' instead of '\0' (Issue 90).
 -- @email - Unnecessary strlen() (Issue 81).
 -- @email - do_plusmail loops look at undefined bytes if inputline is
    1, 2, or 3 bytes long (Issue 89). 
 -- @email - Memory leaks (Issue 84).
 -- Fix SIGSEGV when udefault() gets more than 12 arguments.  Fixed by
    Alierak.
 -- @email - initialize input buffer to the empty string to cover
    return(0) error cases.  Probably introduced by Issue 80 fix.  Fixed
    by Alierak.
 -- @email - Comment doesn't match code (Issue 82).
 -- %v accepts accented characters (Issue 91).  Found by Alierak.
 -- sortby() breaks when nested (Issue 88).  Found by Alierak.

    (Issue 77). Found by Alierak.
 -- Fix theoretical crash if DNS slave returns half a result.  Found and
    fixed by Alierak.
 -- Fix lbuf leak from Issue 88 fix.  Found and fixed by Alierak.
 -- All return paths from process_command(), new_connection(), and
    check_connect() must restore mudstate.debug_cmd.  Found and fixed
    by Alierak.
 -- Multiple addcom gives no warning (Issue 93). Fixed addcom topic.
 -- @email - Message body may be too long to append CRLF.CRLF (Issue 74).
    Found by Alierak.

 -- @email - Accents could affect message validity (Issue 85).  Found by
    Alierak.
 -- Allow addcom to channel names containing spaces (Issue 58).
 -- Fixed channels() help topic (Issue 54).  The channels()
    implementation doesn't not return a comma-space separated list, but
    a space-only separated list.
 -- Fixed an lbuf leak in hasquota() introduced in TinyMUX 2.1. Bug
    found by Alierak.


Performance Enhancements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 -- In MEMORY_BASED, avoid malloc() call each time an attribute is
    added to an object.
 -- Optimize atr_add_raw_LEN() to reduce Firan load time from 40 seconds
    to 15 seconds (which includes firan.db, mail.db, and comsys.db).
    This translates to something upward of 28 MB/s.
 -- Optimize do_comsystem() ability to recognize what is not an alias.
    Alierak.


Cosmetic Changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Miscellaneous:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 -- Add mux_fopen() utility function to replace direct use of fopen().
