Ian's stuff:

Things I did last patch yet to be added:
Job 117
Job 119
Job 124
Job 158

Comments:
    Isn't job 179 dead? The only thing not impliment is @assert.. and,
    well, that might as well be @break not(blah).

    Job 117 was fixed in my last patched but it never made its way into
    MUX, so I'll include it here... (eventually)

    Same thing with 119, fixed, submitted, ignored/overlooked.

    And job 124.. sigh.
