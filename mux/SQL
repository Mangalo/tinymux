TinyMUX 2.7:  SQL
Last Update:  December 2006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When enabling the Firan support (by doing ./configure --enable-firan) in
TinyMUX 2.7 and intending to use SQL, there are some things to setup or
consider.

1) Once you have run './configure --enable-firanmux' you will need to sure
   that TinyMUX 2.7 can locate the mysql.h and libmysqlclient.a files.  If
   they are in their default locations then TinyMUX 2.7 can locate and include
   them automatically without changes required.  The default locations are
   <DEFAULT LOCATIONS>.

   If the files are not in the default location you will need to first locate
   them.  Often 'locate mysql.h' and 'locate libmysqlclient.a' will work on a
   linux/unix system.  You can also do 'find / -name mysql.h' and
   'find / -name libmysqlclient.a'. Once located you will need to edit the
   Makefile file and make a couple of changes. For this example I'll use the
   locations of these files on a FreeBSD system.

      mysql.h : /usr/local/include/mysql/mysql.h
      libmysqlclient.a : /usr/local/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.a

   First you will need to locate the LIBS line in the Makefile, and change it
   to the following.  Remember to change '/usr/local/lib/mysql' to the
   appropriate location for your system:

      LIBS = -L/usr/local/lib/mysql -lm -lcrypt -lmysqlclient

   Then you'll need to locate the OPTIM line in the Makefile, and change it to
   the following. Remember to change '/usr/local/include' to the appropriate
   location for your syste:

      OPTIM = -g -O -I/usr/local/include

   Once done, continue compiling as normal using 'make depend' and then
   'make'.


2) Once the game has been compiled you will need to add four configuration
   options to the .conf file.  The four are listed below:

      sql_database <name of database>
      sql_server <localhost or address>
      sql_user <MySQL username>
      sql_password <MySQL password>


3) Start the game and check the log file. You should two entries like the
   following:

      SQL/CONN : Connecting: <database>@<address> as <user>
      SQL/CONN : Connected to MySQL

   You can use the sql() function to perform MySQL queries.  See 'help sql()'.


4) The SQL code enabled with --enable-firanmux runs synchronous with the
   TinyMUX process.  That means that in the game when you use the sql()
   function to make a query, the whole game waits on the query to finish.  If
   you're on a server which is not overloaded and has good, free resources and
   where the MySQL server is running on the same machine then this should not
   be a problem as long as the MySQL server remains running.  If the server is
   overloaded and therefore slow or if the MySQL server is on a different
   machine, then there can be a delay in getting the results.  That delay will
   mean the whole game hangs while waiting.

   When using the SQL functionality bear this potential problem in mind.  You
   should test your game with the SQL functionality first before using it in a
   live environment.
