TinyMUX 2.6:  BETA
Last Update:  January 2006

General Cautions During the Beta Period:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please take the time to read the README.  These files should be
helpful to you.  If they are not helpful, then please help us improve
the documentation by suggesting specific changes.  Documentation bugs
can usually be fixed more rapidly than any other type of bug.

If you port an existing game to this BETA:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Make frequent backups.  We cannot stress this enough.  The included 
      Backup script is your friend and should make this process effortless. 
    
    - Make complete backups of all of your config, text, mail, and 
      comsystems.
    
    - Store your backups offsite.  This was always prudent anyway.
    
    - Run your game as usual.
    
    - Report Bugs to brazilofmux@gmail.com following the procedure in README.
