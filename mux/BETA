TinyMUX 2.2:  BETA
Last Update:  September 2004

General Cautions During the Beta Period:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More so than TinyMUX 2.0 or 2.1, TinyMUX 2.2 has had several coders working
on the code simultaneously.  We suspect that this will prove to be the cause
of most of it faults.

Some of the changes to TinyMUX 2.2 were features like @hook, @icmd, and
support for the caller substitution for functions and commands, but some
changes were required to fix previously unfixable issues.  So, its a mixed
bag.

Overall, I expect there to be a few surprises, but after these are found
and removed, the stability will be equal to that of TinyMUX 2.0 or 2.1.

Please take the time to read the README.  These files should be
helpful to you.  If they aren't helpful, then please help us improve
our efforts by suggesting specific changes. Documentation bugs can
usually be fixed more rapidly than any other type of bug.

If you port an existing game to this beta:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Make frequent backups.  We cannot stress this enough.  The included 
      Backup script is your friend and should make this process effortless. 
    
    - Make complete backups of all of your config, text, mail, and 
      comsystems.
    
    - Store your backups offsite.  This was always prudent anyway.
    
    - Run your game as usual.
    
    - Report Bugs to brazilofmux@gmail.com following the procedure in README.

    - Keep decompiles of anything really big, unique, or irreplaceable 
      softcode.  This is good coding practice, anyway.
