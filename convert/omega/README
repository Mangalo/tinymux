Omega: README
Last Update: June 2010

This is intended to be the 'last' flatfile convertor.  It currently consumes
and produces PennMUSH and TinyMUX 2.7 flatfiles, but the plan is to add
parsers for other formats.

This can eventually be used to validate backups (lint for your flatfile) --
including which server version should be able to consume it.  It can also
be used to extract a @decomp of specific objects for re-quoting into games.
Finally, it can be used to convert from one format to another in a lossly
fashion.

Tested:

2010-06-27 - Tested that a large flatfile produced by PennMUSH 1.8.0p6
             (12/12/2005, 1008000009) is parsed and re-generated exactly the
             same.

             Round-trip tested minimal+ flatfile produced by PennMUSH 1.8.4p0
             (05/09/2010, 1008004000)

             Round-trip tested minimal+ flatfile produced by PennMUSH 1.8.0p0
             (01/01/2005, 001008008000)

2010-06-28 - Round-trip tested a large TinyMUX 2.7 database. Checked and fixed
             memory leaks in p6h and t5x paths.

             Round-trip tested the TinyMUX 2.6 SGP minimal database.

2010-06-29 - Round-trip an older PennMUSH flatfile (1.7.5p0 or after, but
             before 1.7.7p40).
