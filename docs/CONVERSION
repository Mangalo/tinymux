TinyMUX 2.1: CONVERSION
Last Update: May 2002

Conversions from Other Database Formats:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Support for other database formats has been removed from MUX 2.1. To import
one of the following formats, you must first use dbconvert from TinyMUX 2.0
before using the resulting flatfile with MUX 2.1.

   TinyMUX 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 (not beta)
   TinyMUX(Win32Beta) 1.5, 1.6, 2.0
   TinyMUSH 2.0 (all versions)
   TinyMUSH 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4 release version (not beta)
   TinyMUSH 2.2.4U1 release version (not beta)

Upgrading An Existing TinyMUX:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - @shutdown the game. Make a flatfile of your DB and move it to a safe 
   location.
 
 - Compile MUX 2.1 per INSTALL.  Note that MUX 2.1 untars into a 
   seperate directory.
 
 - Copy the flatfile to game/data in the MUX 2.1 directory and use 
   db_load to convert the database to binary.
 
 - Copy .txt files to text/ 
 
 - Copy existing mux.config
 
 - **Important** Your old GAMENAME.conf file will not work under MUX 2.1.
   To make a proper file, you must edit the GAMENAME.conf in the MUX 2.1 
   game/ and add in the config parameters.
   - You can save a little time by 'cat oldfile >> newfile' and using 
     the editor to remove unneeded lines.
 
 - Copy any existing comsys.db and mail.db files to game/data.  If your 
   game comes up and the mail and/or comsys are not working, make sure 
   that you put the files in the right directory and restart the MUX.
 
 - Restart the game.


Changes to dbconvert:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - One of the major and important changes from MUX 1.x is the use of CHash 
   in the place of GDBM.  You will notice the changes primarily in the way 
   dbconvert and the db_unload and db_load scripts work.  
 
 - dbconvert is the means by which the binary game data is converted to 
   flatfile format and back again.  The db_load and db_unload scripts 
   simplify the process for the user. 
 
 - The syntax of the scripts is:
   
   - './db_load netmux netmux.flat netmux.db'
     
     This converts flatfiled database to binary for use by the server and 
     would be done with dbconvert thus:
     
     ../bin/dbconvert netmux X < netmux.flat > netmux.db
   
   - './db_unload netmux netmux.db.new netmux.flat'
     
     This converts binary data to flatfile for would be done with dbconvert 
     thus:
     
     ../bin/dbconvert netmux x < netmux.db.new > netmux.flat
