This project holds the TinyMUX test cases.  The code is formatted and must be
unformatted before being quoted into a game.

The unformat.pl program, a Perl script, is located in the tools sub-directory.
The upload.tcl, an expect script, is useful for quoting the installer into the
a new database.

Steps to create:

 1. Use './tools/unformat.pl *.mux > out' to create a quotable installer.
 2. Remove netmux.db so that we start with a non-SGP minimal database.
 3. Start the server with ./Startmux
 4. /quote this into the new database using either your choice of client and
    manually @shutdown, or use the included upload.tcl script which performs
    @shutdown automatically.
 5. ./db_unload netmux netmux.db.new smoke.flat
 6. mv smoke.flat ../../../testcases/smoke.flat

The resulting database automatically runs all the tests and then shuts itself
down.  No clients connections are needed to initiate this.

Steps to use (from ./game):

 1. touch .scissors
 2. ./Smoke

The results of the test will be in smoke.log.
