This project holds test cases for TinyMUX. The code is formatted and must be
unformatted before being quoted into a game.

The unformat.pl program is located in the tool sub-directory. This requires
Perl.

Steps to create:

 1. Use './tools/unformat.pl *.mux > out' to create a quotable installer.
 2. Start a non-SGP minimal database by removing netmux.db before ./Startmux
 3. /quote out into the new database.
 4. @shutdown
 5. ./db_unload netmux netmux.db.new smoke.flat
 6. mv smoke.flat ../../../testcases/smoke.flat

Steps to use (from ./game):

 1. touch .scissors
 2. ./Smoke

The results of the test will be in smoke.log.
