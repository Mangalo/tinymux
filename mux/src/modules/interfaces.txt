Proposed Interfaces.

INTERFACE: Low-level File I/O

    Open/Seek/Read/Write/Close/Move/Delete.

The value of this seems really low. These interfaces are already typically in
a shared library.  Perhaps the gloss for VS2005 is becoming substantial enough
that this begins to make sense, but other interfaces should be tackled first.


INTERFACE: Low-level Attribute Access.

This is roughly at the level of CHashFile.  A low-level cach of CHashPages is
included here.


INTERFACE: Attribute Cache.

This is roughly at the attrcache.cpp level.  A higher-level LRU attribute
list is included here, but otherwise the upper and lower interfaces of this
layer is the same.


INTERFACE: High-Level Attribute Access.

This is roughly at the db.cpp level and is also where memory-based access
interjects itself.


INTERFACE: Compression.

Self-evident.


INTERFACE: Managing (add/remove/query) softcode function table.


INTERFACE: Managing (add/remove/query) softcode command table.


INTERFACE: Managing (add/remove/query) softcode powers table.


INTERFACE: Managing (add/remove/query) softcode flags table.


INTERFACE: Managing (add/remove/query) INFO.
