Omega: README
Last Update: June 2010

This is intended to be the 'last' flatfile convertor.  It currently consumes
and produces PennMUSH flatfiles, but the plan is to add parsers for other
formats.

This can eventually be used to validate backups (lint for your flatfile) --
including which server version should be able to consume it.  It can also
be used to extract a @decomp of specific objects for re-quoting into games.
Finally, it can be used to convert from one format to another.

Tested:

2010-06-27 - Tested that a large flatfile produced by PennMUSH 1.8.0p6
             (12/12/2005, 1008000009) is parsed and re-generated exactly the
             same.
