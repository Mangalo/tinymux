TinyMUX 2.1:  BETA
Last Update:  January 2001

General Cautions During the Beta Period:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The breadth of the testing of TinyMUX 2.1 is admittedly not as broad
as that enjoyed by TinyMUX 2.0 when it entered its first BETA.
However, TinyMUX 2.1 does build on the bug fixes of TinyMUX 2.0, and
there are a few production games that have been running it for
approximately 4 months. Ashen-Shugar continues to beat on it.

The stability of this version of TinyMUX is roughly equal to the
stability of the TinyMUX 2.0 version.

Please take the time to read the README.  These files should be
helpful to you.  If they aren't helpful, then please help us improve
our efforts by suggesting specific changes. Documentation bugs can
usually be fixed more rapidly than any other type of bug.

If you port an existing game to this beta:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Make frequent backups.  We cannot stress this enough.  The included 
      Backup script is your friend and should make this process effortless. 
    
    - Make complete backups of all of your config, text, mail, and 
      comsystems.
    
    - Store your backups offsite.  This was always prudent anyway.
    
    - Run your game as usual.
    
    - Report Bugs to sdennis@svdltd.com following the procedure in README.
